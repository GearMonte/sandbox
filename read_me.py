"""
This is another way to comment text in python. 
I learned it at work.

Here are two libraries of value for you:
Pandas
NumPy

You can also create a .py file titled __init__.py
that will act as a go between so that you can call
functions you create from other files similar
to the way that cascading style sheets function for 
HTML. Functions are your friend. Lean on them for help.
Functions you make are referred to as User Defined Functions (UDF's).
I mention that because it will come up as you do research
to find answers.

Python has different names for colums and rows. 
Columns are called series and rows are called indexes.

This is just a test file.
If you do not have the pandas
library installed you can do so
by typing: 

pip install pandas into the terminal.

Short cut for commenting lines plural out: ctl + /

It will add the # symbol infront of any lines highlighted
when you use that short cut.

# import pandas as pd

# df = pd.read_csv("titanic.csv")

# print(df)

# titanic = df

# print(titanic.head())

# Would give you this output if you had the titanic.csv file:
